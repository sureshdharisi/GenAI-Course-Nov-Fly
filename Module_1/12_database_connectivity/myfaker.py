generate_synthetic_customers_orders.py

Purpose:
    Generates synthetic customer and order data for AWS Glue pipeline tutorials.
    Creates two CSV files with referential integrity maintained between customers and orders.

Output Files:
    1. customers.csv - Customer master data
       Columns: customer_id, customer_name, email, city, state, created_at

    2. orders.csv - Order transaction data
       Columns: order_id, customer_id, order_date, status, total_amount

Key Features:
    - Maintains referential integrity (orders only for existing customers)
    - Temporal consistency (orders created after customer registration)
    - Realistic data distribution (weighted status probabilities)
    - Configurable data volume via global constants
    - Graceful fallback if faker library not available

Dependencies:
    Required: csv, random, datetime, os (all stdlib)
    Optional: faker (pip install faker) - for more realistic synthetic data

Usage:
    python generate_synthetic_customers_orders.py

    Customize by modifying the CONFIG section:
    - NUM_CUSTOMERS: Number of customer records to generate
    - NUM_ORDERS: Number of order records to generate
    - RANDOM_SEED: For reproducible datasets

Example:
    generate_synthetic_customers_orders.py
    Generating 200 customers and 2000 orders...
    Files created:
     - datasets/customers.csv
     - datasets/orders.csv
