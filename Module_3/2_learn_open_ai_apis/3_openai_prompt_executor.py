OpenAI API Prompt Executor - Comprehensive Learning Tool

This program demonstrates professional patterns for interacting with OpenAI APIs.
It covers all major prompt engineering techniques with working examples that can
be used as templates for production systems.

Each example is self-contained and demonstrates a specific pattern that solves
real-world problems in classification, content generation, data extraction,
conversation management, and structured output generation.


Prompt Engineering Patterns Explained
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pattern 1: Simple Prompt
    Single user message with no context or history.
    Best for: One-off questions, quick tasks, standalone requests.
    Example: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."

Pattern 2: System Prompt
    Defines AI behavior, personality, or constraints before user input.
    Best for: Consistent tone, role-playing, safety rules, domain expertise.
    Example: System="You are a medical expert" + User="Explain symptoms"

Pattern 3: Multi-Turn Conversation
    Maintains context across multiple exchanges.
    Best for: Chatbots, interviews, guided workflows, progressive disclosure.
    Example: Booking system that remembers what user already said.

Pattern 4: Structured JSON Output
    Forces response into machine-readable format.
    Best for: APIs, automation, data pipelines, agent systems.
    Example: Extract entities and return as {"name": "...", "date": "..."}.

Pattern 5: Streaming Response
    Delivers output incrementally as it generates.
    Best for: Chat interfaces, long responses, better user experience.
    Example: ChatGPT-style interfaces where text appears progressively.

Pattern 6: Few-Shot Learning
    Teaches by example rather than explanation.
    Best for: Custom formatting, unique classifications, pattern matching.
    Example: Show 3 input-output pairs, then process new input.

Pattern 7: Chain-of-Thought
    Asks AI to show reasoning steps before final answer.
    Best for: Math, logic, debugging, transparency, verification.
    Example: "Calculate dosage. Show your work step by step."

Pattern 8: COSTAR Framework
    Enterprise prompt structure for production consistency.
    Best for: Business systems, team alignment, quality control.
    Example: Explicitly define Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Format.

Pattern 9: Batch Processing
    Process multiple similar items efficiently.
    Best for: Data analysis, bulk operations, consistency checks.
    Example: Classify sentiment for 1000 reviews.

Pattern 10: Classification
    Categorize input into predefined groups.
    Best for: Routing, triage, sentiment analysis, content moderation.
    Example: "Is this email SPAM, URGENT, or NORMAL?"

            - Agent outputs that trigger downstream actions

        Error Handling:
